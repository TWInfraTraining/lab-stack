This script can be used to create a complete stack for lab exercises
for each participant in a class. In order to use it you will need to
sign up and install the tools for CloudFormation and SES.

The lab stack is created based on a CloudFormation template which is
stored in infra_lab.template. The lab_stack.sh script however is
fairly coupled with this template at the moment.

In order to simplify the class for the participants lab_stack.sh will
create and upload a hosts file to each of the created machine so they
can refer to one another with friendly names like web.part1.com. The
email sent to the participants will also contain a section that can be
pasted into their /etc/hosts.


USAGE

Run the following to see the proper ways to use lab_stack.sh

./lab_stack.sh -h


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install CloudFormation command line tools either

a) with homebrew

brew install aws-cfn-tools

create a file containing your aws access keys  (ex: ~/.ec2/access.pl)
AWSAccessKeyId=23SDFLJ3LKJ3LKJ3F
AWSSecretKey=843LJK343ljkf4343LJKS/dsflkj43lkjs23KJ

add the following lines to your .bash_profile:
export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=~/.ec2/access.pl
export AWS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=~/.ec2/access.pl
export AWS_CLOUDFORMATION_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/aws-cfn-tools/1.0.8/jars

b) manually

2. Install SES command line tools

Follow the instructions at
http://aws.amazon.com/code/Amazon-SES/8945574369528337 You can put the
tools in /usr/local/ses/bin and add the following to .bash_profile

export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/ses/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/ses/bin
export SES_FROM_EMAIL=<your email address>

3. Verify your email address

Run the following script
ses-verify-email-address.pl -v <your email address>

Open the verification email that Amazon sends you and click on the
link. This will enable you to send emails to yourself only and is
useful for testing. You will then need to request SES production
access. This will take about 24 hours to process.
